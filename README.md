**a soulful way to generate docs for Swift & Objective-C**

jazzy is a command-line utility that generates documentation for your Swift or Objective-C projects.

Instead of parsing your source files, jazzy hooks into clang and uses the AST representation of your code and its comments for more accurate results

jazzy’s output is meant to emulate the look & feel of Apple’s official documentation, post WWDC 2014.

Todo:
- Index generation
- Markdown rendering of long descriptions
- Class inheritance, conforms, import, availability
- Pygmentizing method declarations
- Cross-linking
- Search in page
- Handle availability options
